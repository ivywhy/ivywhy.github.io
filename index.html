  <section id="about">
    <p>
      I am a second-year graduate student in Computer Science and Neuroengineering.  I’ve previously worked on developing computational models of the visual system and physiological circuits.  As of late, I’ve been interested in spectral graph theory and its applications to neuronal dynamics and brain networks.

      I am also a teaching assistant for an introductory Philosophy course on critical thinking.

      In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and playing badminton.
